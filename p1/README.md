## Game planning

### Overview

-   Use global variables for text strings

-   Use an associative array to associate card suit Tailwind CSS color classes

-   Use a multdimensional array and foreach loop to construct the deck

-   Use a while card to deal the cards

-   Use arrays to hold the deck, player hands, and game results

-   Use a while loop to iterate through each round of the game,
    continuing as long as both have cards in their hand or until
    500 rounds have been played, whichever comes first

-   Use conditionals to compare each players card and determine result

-   Store the results of each round in the game array

-   Loop through the game array to display results
